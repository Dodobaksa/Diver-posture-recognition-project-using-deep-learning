## Description

Efficient and safe diver missions require research on underwater human-robot interaction (HRI). The Cognitive Autonomous Driving Buddy (CADDY) project replaces human buddy divers with autonomous underwater vehicles and adds new autonomous surface vehicles to improve the monitoring, support, and safety of divers' missions. The goal of this project is to classify images of divers' hand or body gestures in the aquatic environment.
